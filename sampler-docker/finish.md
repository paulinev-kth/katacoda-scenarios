Congratulations!

You have now finished the tutorial and should be more familiar with sampler.
For more information refer to [the sampler website](https://sampler.dev/). You can find documentation for advanced configuration. You can for example configure shell commands that will be triggered at certain levels. In this scenario, we monitor a local docker container but you can use SSH connexion to connect to a remote server.

As the configuration file is based on shell commands, the only limit is your imagination.
You can also consider contributing to this nice open source project.

Thank you for your time!
