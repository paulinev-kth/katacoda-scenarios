Congratulations!

You have now finished the tutorial and should be more familiar with sampler
For more information refer to [the site](https://sampler.dev/). You can find documentations for advanced configuration. You can for example configure shell commands that will be triggered at certain levels. In this scenario we connect to a local docker container but you can use SSH conexion to connect to a remote server.

As the config file is based on shell command, the only limit is your imagination. 
Don't hesitate to contribute to this nice open source project. 

Thank you for your time!
